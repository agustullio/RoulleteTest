Roullete Game Test

This program it's a simulator of a Roullete Game, where there are 6 players playing as a team but with a different strategy each. At the end of 10000 games, all of them wins and looses would be added to reach a final result and in the best of the cases, the earnings.

The program must be run with the executable "main" at the main folder.

When you run the program, it will generate a log at a .txt file, named RoulleteLog.txt, where you can see the number of the game, the value of the bet of each player and the value of the win or loose of each too.

The program was compiled with the g++ tool, version: (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0
